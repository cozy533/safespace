# safespace üìùüîí

A personal diary management tool written in Bash. It lets you write entries (in nano by default), organize them by date, and securely archive them in a password-protected 7z archive.

## Scripts

### `write-diary-entry.sh`

- Begins a new diary entry if none exists for the current day, or continues an existing one
- Default filename: `MM-DD-YYYY` (option to append a custom title)  
- Uses `nano` for editing, but easily changeable

### `add-diary-entry.sh`

- Archives all diary entries into a password-protected `Diary.7z`  
- Prompts for password for encryption  
- Shows the 3 most recently updated entries from the archive for verification
- Offers to delete the original entries after archiving  

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/cozy533/safespace && cd safespace
```

3. Make the scripts executable:
```
chmod +x write-diary-entry.sh add-diary-entry.sh
```

5. Optional: move the scripts to a directory in your `PATH` for easy access:
```
sudo mv write-diary-entry.sh add-diary-entry.sh /usr/local/bin/
```

## Usage

- Write an entry:
```
.write-diary-entry.sh
```

- Add unarchived entries to `Diary.7z`:
```
./add-diary-entry.sh
```

‚ö†Ô∏è These scripts are designed for personal use; modify `ENTRY_DIR` and `WORKING_DIR` in the scripts if your paths differ. <br>
Please remember to keep your archive password safe, and always keep a backup of `Diary.7z`.
